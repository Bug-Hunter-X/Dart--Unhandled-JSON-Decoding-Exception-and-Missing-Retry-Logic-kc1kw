# Dart: Unhandled JSON Decoding Exception and Missing Retry Logic

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving the handling of asynchronous operations and JSON data. The code fetches data from an API but lacks proper error handling and assumes a specific JSON structure.

## Bug:

The `fetchData` function attempts to access the `'data'` key from the JSON response directly without checking for its existence.  This causes a crash if the API response doesn't contain this key. The `catch` block is also rudimentary and doesn't include any retry mechanisms for transient network errors.

## Solution:

The solution introduces more robust error handling. It checks for the existence of the 'data' key and provides a fallback mechanism. Exponential backoff is implemented for retrying network requests.
